Building Optimized Frontends
===

When a user interacts with our application,
they are hardly concerned with what is going on in the backend.
The experience of the user is directly connected with how the frontend of the application responds to their inputs.
This makes the application frontend not only one of the most important aspects of the application,
but also makes it one of the major deciding factors for the success of the application among its users.

we will take a look at how we can build application frontends that not only provide an easy-to-use experience,
but also a fast response to their inputs.

Throughout the course of this chapter, we learned about why it is important to have an
optimized frontend for our enterprise applications, and how a frontend may affect the use
of our application inside the enterprise. 

We then moved on to understand what kind of
issues usually plague the performance of web frontends, and what possible solutions we
can take to improve the application frontend.

This involves reducing the amount of
resources that are loaded by the frontend, allowing the CSS to load in parallel, bundling
JavaScript, and so on. We then moved on to understand how caching can prove to be useful
considering the use case of an enterprise web application. 

Once we understood the concept
of caching, we then moved into the territory of web storage, which allows us to store a large
amount of data in the client browser, 
allowing easy access to the data without making a
request to the server again and again.

Now, we are ready to take a look at how to mature the process of our application development, 
and to make sure that we deliver an application with the least number of defects as possible. 

The next chapter of this book takes us through the process of making sure that
the application we are building contains the least number of defects through the use of different testing techniques.
